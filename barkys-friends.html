            <h3> Meet Mr.Chubs </h3>
            <p> Mr.Chubs is Barky's best friend. Mr.Chubs is shy and timid at first, but when he gets comfortable with people, he's quite the talker! 
                <br>
                <br> <u> Some of his hobbies include: </u>
                <ul> 
                    <li> Long walks on the beach </li>
                    <li> Reading a good book </li>
                    <li> Trolling on Stack Overflow</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br> <strong> Life before Barky: </strong> I spent my life in a souvenir stores in Chinatown before I was rescued by Vicky

            <h2> <center> <u> Mr Quackers </u> </center> </h2>
            <center> <img src = "mr.quackers.JPG" width = 225.75 height = 228.2> </center>
            <h3> Meet Mr.Quackers </h3>
            <p> Bath time is always tough for Barky, that's why a companion like Mr.Quackers is perfect for Barky to play with while hes getting his monthly bath! 
                Mr.Quackers has a habit of telling "lame" dad jokes, but they get Barky everytime. Be careful though, once he tells a joke, you'll be laughing for at least a second!

                <ul>
                    <li> Telling dad jokes </li>
                    <li> Swimming in the sink </li>
                    
                </ul>
                <br> <strong> Favourite joke: </strong> The best thing about a Boolean is that even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit. 
            </p>
            <br> <strong> Life before Barky: </strong> I spent my life being held captive by the SFU Sosy members. They separated me from my family and started giving us away like we were objects. One day, a boy named Johnson rescued me.

            <h3> Meet Blankie</h3>
            <p> Who better to defend the monsters off in Barky's dreams? Although he's a feisty one, Blankie's got a soft side to him (hehe). One big squeeze of Blankie will make your whole day better!
                Besides that, Blankie's best asset is that he's a bit of a stylistic choice.
                Get ready to be showered in compliments when you walk around with Blankie. You're definitely the coolest cat in the room when you got Blankie on you.
