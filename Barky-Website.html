  <h2> <U> HISTORY </U> </h2>
    <p> Barky is a bog who lived in the forest with the rest of the <strong> <a href = "Definitions.html" target = "blank" > bogs </a> </strong> in the world. 
      Due to their rarity, the bogs were preyed on and eaten by bigger bears. 
      One Summer day, Barky and the rest of the bogs went out to pick berries. 
      Being the curious bog he was, Barky had tasted one too many berries and had accidently eaten a posionous berry. 
      Barky started to feel drowsy and soon collasped into the bush of berries. 
      After a few hours, a girl named Vicky stumbled across Barky in the bush who was still posioned and weak. 
      Vicky took Barky home and made him medicine to cure his weakened immune system. 
      When Barky woke up, Vicky revealed that the rest of the bogs were killed or taken into research facilities to be experimented on and that Barky was the only bog alive. 
      Devistated by the news, Barky began to cry. Vicky gave Barky a big hug and promised to keep Barky safe and to take care of him forever. </p>
