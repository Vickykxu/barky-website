            <h3> Meet Billy the Pig </h3>
            <p> Billy the Pig is Barky's archnemesis. They met in Kindergarden, where Billy started a rumor that Barky's fur had fleas. The whole class made fun of Barky and kept their distance away from him. 
                As a result of the rumor, Barky has been unable to make any friends. From that day, the two have been clashing and trying to make the other look foolish.
