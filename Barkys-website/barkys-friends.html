                <p> Mr.Chubs is Barky's best friend. Mr.Chubs is shy and timid at first, but when he gets comfortable with people, he's quite the talker!

                <h3> Meet Mr.Quackers </h3>
                <p> Bath time is always tough for Barky, that's why a companion like Mr.Quackers is perfect for Barky to play with while hes getting his monthly bath! 
                    Mr.Quackers has a habit of telling "lame" dad jokes, but they get Barky everytime. Be careful though, once he tells a joke, you'll be laughing for at least a second!

                    <br> <strong> Life before Barky: </strong> I spent my life being held captive by the SFU Sosy members. They separated me from my family and started giving us away like we were objects. One day, a boy named Johnson rescued me.

                <h3> Meet Blankie</h3>
                <p> Who better to defend the monsters off in Barky's dreams? Although he's a feisty one, Blankie's got a soft side to him (hehe). One big squeeze of Blankie will make your whole day better!
                    Besides that, Blankie's best asset is that he's a bit of a stylistic choice.
                    Get ready to be showered in compliments when you walk around with Blankie. You're definitely the coolest cat in the room when you got Blankie on you.

                    Barky looks up to Johnson, and inspires Barky to be a multi-hat wearer as well! Besides spending time with Barky, you can often find Johnson at the library studying with Osha.

                <p> Barky's first wagon pusher. Josher is a hard worker but sometimes he can be a bit mean. Don't worry though, he doesn't mean it, or at least we don't think he does... 
                    Josher is always there to push Barky's wagon up the highest of hills, and when the wagon rolls away, Josher is there to chase after it!
