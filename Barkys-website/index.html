        <h2> <U> HISTORY </U> </h2>
          <p> Barky is a bog who lived in the forest with the rest of the <strong> <a href = "Definitions.html" > bogs </a> </strong> in the world. 
            Due to their rarity, the bogs were preyed on and eaten by bigger bears. 
            One Summer day, Barky and the rest of the bogs went out to pick berries. 
            Being the curious bog he was, Barky had tasted one too many berries and had accidently eaten a posionous berry. 
            Barky started to feel drowsy and soon collasped into the bush of berries. 
            After a few hours, a girl named Vicky stumbled across Barky in the bush who was still posioned and weak. 
            Vicky took Barky home and made him medicine to cure his weakened immune system. 
            When Barky woke up, Vicky revealed that the rest of the bogs were killed or taken into research facilities to be experimented on and that Barky was the only bog alive. 
            Devastated by the news, Barky began to cry. Vicky gave Barky a big hug and promised to keep Barky safe and to take care of him forever. </p>

        <li> Effectiveness: Normal effectiveness </li>

        <li> Weakness: Humans that tickle Barky back </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> 1-2! </h3>
        <ul> 
        <li> Description: You don't want to catch these paws when Barky comes out and does the 1-2, 1-2, 1-2! His speed is unmatched making it impossible to dodge his punches.
          However, Barky's 1-2 punches lack strength, therefore they're not very effective...  </li>
        <li> Effectiveness: Low effectiveness </li>

        <h3> Fast dash </h3>
        <ul>  
        <li> Description: Bath time is finally over and Barky runs out of the bathroom before getting dried. As he runs, he leaves a trail of water behind him causing those behind him to slip
          on the trail or slows them down. </li>

        <li> Weakness: Barky may slip on the trail of water </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Double Kick </h3>
        <ul>
        <li> Description: Barky kicks with both legs and falls on his butt. The kick has a 10% chance of landing and one shots anything if it does. </li>
        <li> Effectiveness: High effectiveness or none </li>
        <li> Weakness: If double kick fails, Barky will feel the effects of falling on his butt, ouch! </li>
